# Word Game

## Joy of React, Project I

This project, is a recreation of a popular online word game, Wordle:

I approached this project in a freestyle way to learn and to improve my logical thinking and problem solving. I also added bunch of features to supplement what I've learned.

## Additional features that I added

- Timer while guessing the actual word
- Word meaning when the player failed to guess the actual word
- Improvements on the API call (status such as loading and error)
- Categories of the of the actual words
- UI on the banner (button)
- confetti whenever the user guess the correct answer
- Instruction to the user, dialog (on going)
- Keyboard on screen (on going)

## What did I learn?

- React useState
- React useEffect
- Handling API calls
- Reusable components
- Async function (AJAX)
- Able to break down multiple lines of CSS (to modular styles)
- Breaking down the function into a more manageable structure
- Problem-solving on how to solve a specific problem
- Able to improve my research skills

> I think that's all! It was a great project, and I really enjoyed the process of creating it, I was also fulfilling that I manage to add some of the features that I want.
